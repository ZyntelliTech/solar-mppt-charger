# Safety Instructions

The charge controller shall be used only for the intended application.

- The maximum voltage and power of the connected solar panel must not exceed the limits of the charge controller. Make sure to consider also the increased voltage of solar panels at low ambient temperatures.

- Ensure that the charge controller is configured correctly for the used battery type.

- Use lithium ion batteries (e.g. LiFePO4) only if they contain an integrated battery management system (BMS) for additional protection.

Install the device considering general best practices for electrical and mechanical installations in accordance to laws in your country.

- An additional fuse must be installed as close to the battery positive terminal as possible.

- As sparks can occur during connection of the battery or solar panel wires, don't install the charge controller close to any flammable materials.

- The wire cross-section has to be large enough to handle at least the maximum specified current of the charge controller.

- Use insulated tools only.

- Fix the wires outside the charge controller to provide a strain relief.

- Mount the device vertically on a solid, non-inflammable wall only, with the battery terminals facing downwards.

- Keep free space for ventilation next to the device and don't cover the housing.
